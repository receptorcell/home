## Story

You are one of several villagers that have banded together in hope of reclaiming treasure stolen by a group of dragons. You've been promised various amounts of coin if you can find the treasure and return it to your kingdom. But keep watch of other villagers, for although you agreed to join this group because there is strength in numbers, others may be in it just for the promise of coin earned for treasures returned to their very own kingdoms.

Reclaim treasure by matching tile pairs
23 different treasures to reclaim
4 playable kingdoms (Red / Green / Blue / Black)
Team up with villagers from same kingdoms
Complete individual quests to earn extra coin
Stay away from the dragons breath (otherwise you will lose already reclaimed treasure)
Find all 4 dragons to end the round (hopefully keeping your reclaimed treasure & earning extra coin)

## Objective

To be the villager who has earned the most coin for their reclaimed treasures at the end of the game.

## Gameplay

Players take turns trying to match tile pairs to reclaim treasure and earn coin when the treasure is returned to their kingdom at the end of a round. Gold treasure are worth 3 coin each and all other treasure are worth 1 coin each. Matching helmet/sword/shield treasure to kingdom gem icons earn extra coin. Matching the dragons breath will cause the player to lose their most valuable reclaimed treasure. A round ends when all four Dragons have been found... but the player who ends the round needs to have a Shield treasure to protect everyone, otherwise players may lose all their reclaimed treasure for the round (note: it's a good thing to have an Invisibility Cloak treasure). Stay away from the Dragons Breath... matching of these tiles will cause you to lose your most valuable reclaimed treasure.
